# Function: useAsyncQueuer()

```ts
function useAsyncQueuer<TValue, TSelected>(
   fn, 
   options, 
selector): PreactAsyncQueuer<TValue, TSelected>;
```

Defined in: [preact-pacer/src/async-queuer/useAsyncQueuer.ts:235](https://github.com/dogmar/pacer/blob/main/packages/preact-pacer/src/async-queuer/useAsyncQueuer.ts#L235)

A lower-level Preact hook that creates an `AsyncQueuer` instance for managing an async queue of items.

Features:
- Priority queue support via getPriority option
- Configurable concurrency limit
- Task success/error/completion callbacks
- FIFO (First In First Out) or LIFO (Last In First Out) queue behavior
- Pause/resume task processing
- Task cancellation
- Item expiration to clear stale items from the queue

Tasks are processed concurrently up to the configured concurrency limit. When a task completes,
the next pending task is processed if below the concurrency limit.

Error Handling:
- If an `onError` handler is provided, it will be called with the error and queuer instance
- If `throwOnError` is true (default when no onError handler is provided), the error will be thrown
- If `throwOnError` is false (default when onError handler is provided), the error will be swallowed
- Both onError and throwOnError can be used together - the handler will be called before any error is thrown
- The error state can be checked using the underlying AsyncQueuer instance

## State Management and Selector

The hook uses TanStack Store for reactive state management. You can subscribe to state changes
in two ways:

**1. Using `queuer.Subscribe` HOC (Recommended for component tree subscriptions)**

Use the `Subscribe` HOC to subscribe to state changes deep in your component tree without
needing to pass a selector to the hook. This is ideal when you want to subscribe to state
in child components.

**2. Using the `selector` parameter (For hook-level subscriptions)**

The `selector` parameter allows you to specify which state changes will trigger a re-render
at the hook level, optimizing performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders when irrelevant
state changes occur.

**By default, there will be no reactive state subscriptions** and you must opt-in to state
tracking by providing a selector function or using the `Subscribe` HOC. This prevents unnecessary
re-renders and gives you full control over when your component updates.

Available state properties:
- `activeItems`: Items currently being processed by the queuer
- `errorCount`: Number of task executions that have resulted in errors
- `expirationCount`: Number of items that have been removed due to expiration
- `isEmpty`: Whether the queuer has no items to process
- `isFull`: Whether the queuer has reached its maximum capacity
- `isIdle`: Whether the queuer is not currently processing any items
- `isRunning`: Whether the queuer is active and will process items automatically
- `items`: Array of items currently waiting to be processed
- `itemTimestamps`: Timestamps when items were added for expiration tracking
- `lastResult`: The result from the most recent task execution
- `pendingTick`: Whether the queuer has a pending timeout for processing the next item
- `rejectionCount`: Number of items that have been rejected from being added
- `settledCount`: Number of task executions that have completed (success or error)
- `size`: Number of items currently in the queue
- `status`: Current processing status ('idle' | 'running' | 'stopped')
- `successCount`: Number of task executions that have completed successfully

## Unmount behavior

By default, the hook stops the queuer and aborts any in-flight task executions when the component unmounts.
Abort only cancels underlying operations (e.g. fetch) when the abort signal from `getAbortSignal()` is passed to them.
Use the `onUnmount` option to customize this. For example, to flush pending items instead:

```tsx
const queuer = useAsyncQueuer(fn, {
  concurrency: 2,
  started: false,
  onUnmount: (q) => q.flush()
});
```

Note: For async utils, `flush()` returns a Promise and runs fire-and-forget in the cleanup.
If your task function updates Preact state, those updates may run after the component has
unmounted, which can cause "setState on unmounted component" warnings. Guard your callbacks
accordingly when using onUnmount with flush.

## Example

```tsx
// Default behavior - no reactive state subscriptions
const asyncQueuer = useAsyncQueuer(
  async (item) => {
    const result = await processItem(item);
    return result;
  },
  { concurrency: 2, maxSize: 100, started: false }
);

// Subscribe to state changes deep in component tree using Subscribe HOC
<asyncQueuer.Subscribe selector={(state) => ({ size: state.size })}>
  {({ size }) => (
    <div>Queue Size: {size}</div>
  )}
</asyncQueuer.Subscribe>

// Opt-in to re-render when queue size changes at hook level (optimized for displaying queue length)
const asyncQueuer = useAsyncQueuer(
  async (item) => {
    const result = await processItem(item);
    return result;
  },
  { concurrency: 2, maxSize: 100, started: false },
  (state) => ({
    size: state.size,
    isEmpty: state.isEmpty,
    isFull: state.isFull
  })
);

// Opt-in to re-render when processing state changes (optimized for loading indicators)
const asyncQueuer = useAsyncQueuer(
  async (item) => {
    const result = await processItem(item);
    return result;
  },
  { concurrency: 2, maxSize: 100, started: false },
  (state) => ({
    isRunning: state.isRunning,
    isIdle: state.isIdle,
    status: state.status,
    activeItems: state.activeItems,
    pendingTick: state.pendingTick
  })
);

// Opt-in to re-render when execution metrics change (optimized for stats display)
const asyncQueuer = useAsyncQueuer(
  async (item) => {
    const result = await processItem(item);
    return result;
  },
  { concurrency: 2, maxSize: 100, started: false },
  (state) => ({
    successCount: state.successCount,
    errorCount: state.errorCount,
    settledCount: state.settledCount,
    expirationCount: state.expirationCount,
    rejectionCount: state.rejectionCount
  })
);

// Opt-in to re-render when results are available (optimized for data display)
const asyncQueuer = useAsyncQueuer(
  async (item) => {
    const result = await processItem(item);
    return result;
  },
  {
    concurrency: 2,
    maxSize: 100,
    started: false,
    onSuccess: (result) => {
      console.log('Item processed:', result);
    },
    onError: (error) => {
      console.error('Processing failed:', error);
    }
  },
  (state) => ({
    lastResult: state.lastResult,
    successCount: state.successCount
  })
);

// Add items to queue
asyncQueuer.addItem(newItem);

// Start processing
asyncQueuer.start();

// Access the selected state (will be empty object {} unless selector provided)
const { size, isRunning, activeItems } = asyncQueuer.state;
```
