# Function: useQueuedValue()

```ts
function useQueuedValue<TValue, TSelected>(
   initialValue, 
   options, 
   selector?): [TValue, PreactQueuer<TValue, TSelected>];
```

Defined in: [preact-pacer/src/queuer/useQueuedValue.ts:103](https://github.com/dogmar/pacer/blob/main/packages/preact-pacer/src/queuer/useQueuedValue.ts#L103)

A Preact hook that creates a queued value that processes state changes in order with an optional delay.
This hook uses useQueuer internally to manage a queue of state changes and apply them sequentially.

The queued value will process changes in the order they are received, with optional delays between
processing each change. This is useful for handling state updates that need to be processed
in a specific order, like animations or sequential UI updates.

The hook returns a tuple containing:
- The current queued value
- The queuer instance with control methods

## State Management and Selector

The hook uses TanStack Store for reactive state management via the underlying queuer instance.
The `selector` parameter allows you to specify which queuer state changes will trigger a re-render,
optimizing performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders when irrelevant state changes occur.

**By default, there will be no reactive state subscriptions** and you must opt-in to state
tracking by providing a selector function. This prevents unnecessary re-renders and gives you
full control over when your component updates. Only when you provide a selector will the
component re-render when the selected state values change.

Available queuer state properties:
- `executionCount`: Number of items that have been processed by the queuer
- `expirationCount`: Number of items that have been removed due to expiration
- `isEmpty`: Whether the queuer has no items to process
- `isFull`: Whether the queuer has reached its maximum capacity
- `isIdle`: Whether the queuer is not currently processing any items
- `isRunning`: Whether the queuer is active and will process items automatically
- `items`: Array of items currently waiting to be processed
- `itemTimestamps`: Timestamps when items were added for expiration tracking
- `pendingTick`: Whether the queuer has a pending timeout for processing the next item
- `rejectionCount`: Number of items that have been rejected from being added
- `size`: Number of items currently in the queue
- `status`: Current processing status ('idle' | 'running' | 'stopped')

## Type Parameters

### TValue

`TValue`

### TSelected

`TSelected` *extends* `Pick`\<`QueuerState`\<`TValue`\>, `"items"`\> = `Pick`\<`QueuerState`\<`TValue`\>, `"items"`\>

## Parameters

### initialValue

`TValue`

### options

[`PreactQueuerOptions`](../interfaces/PreactQueuerOptions.md)\<`TValue`, `TSelected`\> = `{}`

### selector?

(`state`) => `TSelected`

## Returns

\[`TValue`, [`PreactQueuer`](../interfaces/PreactQueuer.md)\<`TValue`, `TSelected`\>\]

## Example

```tsx
// Default behavior - no reactive state subscriptions
const [value, queuer] = useQueuedValue(initialValue, {
  wait: 500, // Wait 500ms between processing each change
  started: true // Start processing immediately
});

// Opt-in to re-render when queue processing state changes (optimized for loading indicators)
const [value, queuer] = useQueuedValue(
  initialValue,
  { wait: 500, started: true },
  (state) => ({
    isRunning: state.isRunning,
    isIdle: state.isIdle,
    status: state.status,
    pendingTick: state.pendingTick
  })
);

// Opt-in to re-render when queue contents change (optimized for displaying queue status)
const [value, queuer] = useQueuedValue(
  initialValue,
  { wait: 500, started: true },
  (state) => ({
    size: state.size,
    isEmpty: state.isEmpty,
    isFull: state.isFull
  })
);

// Opt-in to re-render when execution metrics change (optimized for stats display)
const [value, queuer] = useQueuedValue(
  initialValue,
  { wait: 500, started: true },
  (state) => ({
    executionCount: state.executionCount,
    expirationCount: state.expirationCount,
    rejectionCount: state.rejectionCount
  })
);

// Add changes to the queue
const handleChange = (newValue) => {
  queuer.addItem(newValue);
};

// Control the queue
const pauseProcessing = () => {
  queuer.stop();
};

const resumeProcessing = () => {
  queuer.start();
};

// Access the selected queuer state (will be empty object {} unless selector provided)
const { size, isRunning, executionCount } = queuer.state;
```
